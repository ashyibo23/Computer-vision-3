# Computer-Vision-3
High Level computer vision/Object Detection

Task caveat : Neural Network not permitted for this task.

Design and implementation of computer vision systems that can identify and count specific types of object from the image.

There are 12 training images containing various pieces of LEGO. Your code needs to provide a count of the number of Blue 2 by 4 bricks (objectA) and the number of Red 2 by 2 bricks (objectB) in such an image. Close-up images of these two types of LEGO brick plus training images are provided with this repositories.

There are several methods has been implemented for this task to accomplish by using machine learning algorithms bag of words/features, K Nearest Neighbour to train the model for classyfing objects and classical computer vision aproaches to achieve 70% to 80% accuracy rate and less than 0.50 MSE.
